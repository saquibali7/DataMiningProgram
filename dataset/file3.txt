Amidst distant planets, a nebula exudes vibrant colors, creating cosmic harmony. Celestial laughter mingles with comets' dance, a symphony in space. Raindrops of awe tap on galaxies' windows, reminding us of mysteries in celestial cafes. A universe's masterpiece, where stars strum guitars, painting tranquility.
